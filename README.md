# Datasets
**Disclaimer:** This repository serves as a storage for datasets used in my academic assignments and machine learning projects within the Informatics Engineering program.
The datasets hosted here are primarily sourced from public repositories (such as Kaggle) and are mirrored solely to facilitate direct access via raw URLs for Google Colab notebooks without any commercial intent.
Full credit belongs to the original data contributors; if you are the dataset owner and wish for specific files to be removed, please submit a request via this repository’s Issues page.
